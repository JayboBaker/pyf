_Our team worked on the exterior of Ianya. We stripped back the old varnish on the house to remove all the yellowing and sun damage, we then Sprayed the three final coats with AWLCraft 2000 High gloss._ 

_We also repaired both rails applied 6 coats of build up varnish and 3 coats of AWLGrip High Gloss_.
