  ## Interior


  Pinnacle Yacht finishing are specialists in Interior varnish work. We use only
  the best and most advanced products in the industry for durability and high
  quality and perfect finish.


  With our extensive product knowledge our team have the skills to tint and
  whitewash woods to match any colour or sheen.


  For interior work we often use a spray finish for the very best quality. We
  quickly and efficiently build onboard spray cabins installing the correct
  extraction units to not only ensure a flawless finish but ensure the health
  and safety of your crew too.

  ## Exterior


  We are very proud of our exterior finishes and are experts in all areas
  whether we are stripping back to bare wood and restoring the wood to its
  former beauty or just giving a fresh look by enhancing the finish with small
  spot repairs and extra coats of varnish, our team are here to make that
  happen. We use the appropriate technique to always give a flawless finish
  either using a brush or spraying. We also know how important the Sika work is
  onboard and are happy to replace and or repair around the varnish whenever
  necessary.


  We know how awful sun damage is for varnish and you can be sure that all our
  products have the highest UV filter
