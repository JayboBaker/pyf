  ## Interior


  Specialist in interior varnish work. We use only the best and most advanced products in the industry, for durability and a high-quality perfect finish.


  With our extensive product knowledge, our team have the skills to tint and whitewash wood to match any colour or sheen for your yacht. 


  For interior work, we often use a spray varnish finish for the very best quality. We quickly and efficiently build onboard spray cabins, installing the correct extraction units, to not only ensure a flawless finish, but for the health and safety of your crew. 


  ## Exterior


  We are experts in all areas and are very proud of our exterior varnish finishes. Whether you want us to strip back to the bare wood to restore to its former beauty, or just give a fresh look by enhancing the finish with small spot repairs and extra coats of varnish. 


  Our team are here to make it happen.


  We adapt to use the appropriate technique; brush or spraying, to always give a flawless finish. We also know how important the Sika work is onboard your boat and are happy to replace and or repair around the varnish whenever necessary.


  All our products have the highest UV filter, to prevent the effects of sun damage.

  ## Touch Up Repairs


  If you need a quick fix, but don’t have time in your busy schedule. We can provide on board touch up repairs, executed to an extremely high standard. 


  Scratches, dings or delamination, we can fix the damage using high quality Konig Waxes, pens and resins, to make sure we get the best possible match.
